## Game Flow
1. The player starts at the ambulance/firetruck area with a firefighter (or a team).
2. The player explores the map, rescuing hikers and collecting power-ups.
3. Fires spawn randomly and spread over time, with optional explosions.
4. The game constantly checks for loss conditions:
   - Excessive fire spread
   - Too many hikers lost
   - Firefighter HP depleted
5. The player wins by:
   - Rescuing all hikers, **or**
   - Containing the majority of fires on the map.

## Challenges
- Designing and building the forest map.
- Creating readable and intuitive firefighting interactions.
- Updating the environment visually after fires spread or are extinguished.
- Building a balanced yet unpredictable fire-spreading system.
- Managing project scope to ensure feasibility.
